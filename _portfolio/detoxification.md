title: "Language Model Detoxification"
collection: portfolio
excerpt: "Dual-stage system for detecting and rewriting toxic content using transformers and large language models."
---

### Overview
This project was developed as part of my Master’s thesis and focuses on controlling and mitigating toxic language generation in NLP systems.

### Key Contributions
- Designed a dual-stage pipeline combining:
  - Transformer-based toxicity classification (ModernBERT)
  - Controlled text rewriting using an instruction-tuned LLM (mT0-XL)
- Evaluated on PAN-2024/2025 and Jigsaw toxicity datasets
- Used automatic metrics (STA, SIM, ChrF) alongside qualitative error analysis

### Focus Areas
- Model behavior control  
- Robustness and evaluation of generative systems  
- Reproducible experimentation
