### Overview
A personal research and engineering project exploring race strategy optimization in Formula 1 using real-world telemetry data.

### Key Components
- Time-series simulation of race scenarios
- Modeling tire degradation, pit stop timing, and undercut/overcut strategies
- Strategy comparison under varying race conditions
- Visualization-driven analysis for decision support

### Tools & Techniques
- Python-based simulation pipelines  
- Telemetry and lap-time data analysis  
- Scenario-based modeling and evaluation  

### Focus
This project combines **systems thinking, data analysis, and simulation**, emphasizing interpretable strategy evaluation rather than black-box prediction.
