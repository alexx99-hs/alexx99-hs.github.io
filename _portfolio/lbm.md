### Overview
A rule-based behavioral control layer designed to sit on top of machine learning and LLM-based systems.

### Key Features
- Explicit decision logic and signal interpretation
- Priority-based rules with cooldowns
- Human-in-the-loop controllability
- Designed for adaptive educational systems

### Why It Matters
This project emphasizes **explainability and safety**, avoiding opaque end-to-end decision making in favor of interpretable system behavior.
