Hi, I’m **Mahrokh Hassani**.

I am an **AI engineer** with a Master’s degree in **Artificial Intelligence** and a background in software engineering. My work has focused on building, analyzing, and evaluating machine learning systems in settings where model behavior, controllability, and robustness matter. I have experience designing end-to-end pipelines, working with modern ML and LLM-based systems, and iterating on system behavior through structured evaluation.

During my Master’s, I worked on **detoxification and behavior control of language models**, designing a dual-stage system that combined a transformer-based toxicity classifier with controlled text rewriting using large language models. This work emphasized reproducible experimentation, prompt and decoding analysis, and evaluation using both automatic metrics and qualitative error analysis.

Alongside this, I have been involved in the design of **agent-based and behavioral AI systems**, including work on a **rule-based Large Behavioral Model (LBM)** layer for adaptive educational systems. This work focused on explicit decision logic, signal interpretation, and safe system actions, with an emphasis on explainability and human-in-the-loop control rather than opaque end-to-end learning.

In parallel with my technical work, **music has been a long-standing creative practice for me**.I am exploring digital music production and playing instruments actively. Over time, it has increasingly influenced how I think about data, structure, and representation. This has led me to become interested in **music and audio as computational objects**, and in how signal processing and learning-based approaches can be applied to sound and musical structure.

Rather than treating music and engineering as separate domains, I am interested in their overlap: how techniques from machine learning, representation learning, and signal processing can support **creative and expressive systems**, and how musical structure and perception raise meaningful technical and research questions.

My current goal is to continue developing as an AI engineer while working at the intersection of **music, audio, and computation**, in environments that value both rigorous system design and creative exploration.
