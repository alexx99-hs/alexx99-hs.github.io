Music has been a long-term creative practice for me, alongside my work in AI and software engineering.

I am actively exploring **digital music production**, working with a digital audio workstation to create original beats and musical sketches. My work focuses on rhythm, texture, structure, and sound design, and I treat music production as an iterative and exploratory process rather than a finished product pipeline.

In addition to digital production, I have experience **playing musical instruments**, including guitar, which informs how I think about musical structure, timing, and expression. This hands-on engagement with music shapes how I approach sound not only as a creative medium, but also as a signal and a system.

My interest in music is closely connected to my technical background. I am particularly motivated by questions around how music and audio can be **represented, analyzed, and generated computationally**, and how machine learning and signal processing methods can support creative workflows and human–AI co-creative systems.

Below are selected examples of my ongoing music production work, including beats and audio sketches.
